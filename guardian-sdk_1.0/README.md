# **Guardian SDK**

**Guardian SDK** is a powerful toolkit designed for developers building decentralized applications (DApps) on the Solana blockchain. It integrates essential features such as smart contract auditing, fraud detection, decentralized dispute resolution, token management, and rewards. This SDK enables seamless interaction with Solana's blockchain and provides advanced AI-powered tools for auditing contracts, detecting fraud in real-time, and resolving disputes.

## **Introduction**
The **Guardian SDK** allows developers to easily integrate powerful features into their Solana-based DApps. The SDK offers a comprehensive suite of tools, including:
- **Smart Contract Auditing**: Analyze smart contracts for vulnerabilities using AI.
- **Real-Time Fraud Detection**: Detect and flag suspicious activity in real-time.
- **Decentralized Dispute Resolution**: Implement decentralized voting or AI-driven decisions for conflict resolution.
- **SPL Token Management**: Mint, transfer, and burn SPL tokens on Solana.
- **Rewards System**: Reward users with Solana or custom SPL tokens for contributions.

The SDK is designed to be modular, allowing developers to pick and choose the features they need.

## **Features**
- **Solana Blockchain Interface**: Interact with Solana blockchain for account management and transactions.
- **SPL Token Management**: Easily manage SPL tokens, including creation, transfer, and burning.
- **AI-Powered Smart Contract Auditing**: Analyze smart contracts for security vulnerabilities using pre-trained machine learning models.
- **Real-Time Fraud Detection**: Identify and flag fraudulent transactions using machine learning models.
- **Decentralized Dispute Resolution**: Use decentralized voting or AI-based decision-making to resolve disputes.
- **Reward System**: Distribute Solana or SPL tokens as rewards.

## **System Requirements**
To use this SDK, you'll need:
- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **Solana CLI**: To interact with the Solana blockchain.
- **TensorFlow.js** (for machine learning models used in smart contract auditing and fraud detection).
- **Hugging Face Transformers** (for NLP-based dispute resolution).

### **Dependencies**:
- `@solana/web3.js`
- `@solana/spl-token`
- `@tensorflow/tfjs-node`
- `@huggingface/transformers`

## **Installation**
1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Navigate to the project folder and run the following command to install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. If you're using machine learning models for contract auditing or fraud detection, ensure you have the models saved locally (the SDK expects them at `./models/contractAuditModel` and `./models/fraudDetectionModel`).

## **Configuration**
1. Ensure your Solana CLI is properly configured to interact with the correct network (e.g., `devnet` or `mainnet`).
2. If you're using the AI-powered features (smart contract auditing or fraud detection), ensure you have access to the pre-trained models and place them in the correct directories.
3. The SDK can be customized to use different AI models, modify the `loadModel` paths in the relevant modules.

## **Usage**

### **Connecting to Solana**
The SDK provides an easy way to interact with Solana’s blockchain. You can create accounts, check balances, and send transactions.

```javascript
const Solana = require('./modules/solana');
const solana = new Solana('devnet');  // Connect to Solana devnet

const solanaAccount = await solana.createAccount();
console.log('Account Created:', solanaAccount.publicKey.toString());

const balance = await solana.getBalance(solanaAccount.publicKey);
console.log('Account Balance:', balance);

// Sending a transaction
await solana.sendTransaction(solanaAccount, 'recipientPublicKey', 0.5);
```

### **Managing SPL Tokens**
You can create, transfer, and burn SPL tokens using the `SPLToken` module.

```javascript
const SPLToken = require('./modules/splToken');
const splToken = new SPLToken(solana.connection);

const { token, userTokenAccount } = await splToken.createToken(solanaAccount, 1000);
console.log('Created SPL Token with address:', token.publicKey.toString());

// Transfer tokens
await splToken.transferTokens(userTokenAccount, 'recipientPublicKey', token, 500);
console.log('500 tokens transferred.');

// Burn tokens
await splToken.burnTokens(userTokenAccount, token, 200);
console.log('200 tokens burned.');
```

### **Smart Contract Auditing**
Audit smart contracts using AI models for vulnerabilities like reentrancy or overflow. This uses a pre-trained model stored locally.

```javascript
const SmartContractAuditing = require('./modules/smartContractAuditing');
const auditing = new SmartContractAuditing('./models/contractAuditModel');

const auditResults = await auditing.runAudit('./contracts/contract.sol');
console.log('Smart Contract Audit Results:', auditResults);
```

### **Fraud Detection**
Detect real-time fraudulent activities based on transaction patterns using machine learning.

```javascript
const FraudDetection = require('./modules/fraudDetection');
const fraudDetection = new FraudDetection('./models/fraudDetectionModel');

const fraudResults = await fraudDetection.monitorTransactions({
  amount: 1200,
  count: 3,
  timeframe: 50,
});
console.log('Fraud Detection Results:', fraudResults);
```

### **Decentralized Dispute Resolution**
Implement decentralized voting or AI-based decisions to resolve disputes.

```javascript
const DisputeResolution = require('./modules/disputeResolution');
const disputeResolution = new DisputeResolution();

disputeResolution.createDispute('initiatorPublicKey', 'Dispute details here');

// Resolve using voting or AI
const resolution = await disputeResolution.resolveDisputeWithAI(1);
console.log('Dispute Resolution:', resolution);
```

### **Rewarding Participants**
Reward users with Solana or SPL tokens for their contributions.

```javascript
const Rewards = require('./modules/rewards');
const rewards = new Rewards(solana, splToken);

await rewards.rewardWithSolana('userPublicKey', 1);
console.log('1 SOL rewarded to user.');

await rewards.rewardWithSPLToken('userPublicKey', token, 100);
console.log('100 SPL tokens rewarded to user.');
```

## **Integration with a DApp**

To integrate the Guardian SDK with your DApp:

1. **Install the SDK**: Include the SDK in your DApp’s project.
   - Clone the SDK repository or include it as a dependency.
   - Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

2. **Connect to Solana**: Initialize the `Solana` instance to interact with the blockchain.
   - Ensure your DApp is set up to interact with Solana (e.g., using `@solana/web3.js` for transactions).
   
3. **Use the SPL Token and Reward System**: Incorporate the SPL token management features to mint and transfer tokens based on user activity in your DApp.
   - Example: Reward users for participating in the DApp or completing certain actions.

4. **Integrate Fraud Detection**: Use the fraud detection system to monitor user activity and flag suspicious behavior in real-time.

5. **Deploy Smart Contracts**: Use the contract auditing feature to verify your smart contracts before deploying them on the blockchain.

6. **Dispute Resolution**: Use the decentralized dispute resolution module to resolve user conflicts in your DApp.

## **Contributing**
